GREAT SUCCESS (Lava Lamp + Stardust): 

"Far OUT! Now this is what I call cosmic! The colors, man... they're speaking to me! You're on my wavelength, bartender!"

Ziggy also changes color to match the color of the drink + lava lamp and sparkle effect


SUCCESS (One of Lava Lamp or Stardust):

With Lava Lamp: "Almost there, daddy-o! The vibe is flowing, but it needs that extra shine, you dig?"

With Stardust: "Dig those sparkles! But it could use something more... radical, if you catch my drift."

Ziggy also changes color to match the drink + either lava lamp or sparkle effect


EHHHH (Visually Interesting But Wrong):

Spark Syrup + (Berry Brew / Frost Vodka / Fireball Whiskey): "Huh... neat light show, but not quite groovy enough. Need something more... far out."

Molten Metal + (Spark Syrup / Berry Brew) : "Too static, man. I need something that flows with the cosmic waves."

Berry Brew + Blossom Petals: "A little too garden party, not enough space party, you know what I mean?"

Molten Metal + Frost Vodka: "Whoa... cool chrome vibes, but I need something more... psychedelic."

Spark Syrup + Bubbly Water: "Dig the electricity, baby, but it's all fizz and no flow!"

Ziggy also changes color to match the drink


FAILURE (Any Earthy, or anything Boring, or only one item):

Plain/Boring Combinations: "...this is squaresville, baby. Where's the pizzazz? The movement? The GROOVE?"

Earthy: "What am I, some kind of tree hugger? I need something that'll make my scales dance!"

Ziggy also changes color to grey [no fun!]
