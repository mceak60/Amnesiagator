GREAT SUCCESS (Contains Earthy + Flora + Fruity): 

"Ah, blessed harmony! Like a forest chapel in spring. The earth, the blossoms, the fruits of creation... You truly understand the natural order, my child."

Closes eyes to contemplate.

SUCCESS (Two of: Earthy, Flora, Fruity):

With Earthy + Flora: "A blessed combination, though it yearns for the sweetness of the vine, much like our garden of contemplation."

With Earthy + Fruity: "The earthen foundation supports the fruit beautifully, though it lacks the grace of the blossom. Still, a worthy offering."

With Flora + Fruity: "A delightful blend of backyard pleasures, though it could something use more solid, to ground it, shall we say?"

EHHHH (One of: Earthy, Flora, Fruity):

Single Earthy/Flora/Fruity: "The spirit is willing, but the blend is weak. Consider the whole of creation, not just a single facet."

Plain Bubbly Water: "My child, simplicity has its virtues, but perhaps we're being a bit too... ascetic?"

Stardust Sprinkles: "Certainly a hint of the divine. But surely we can aim closer to our surroundings." 

Ice only: "Do not test me, my child."

FAILURE (Anything out of the ordinary):

Heat: "Oh my! *cough* A bit too... infernal for my taste."
Cold: "I'm not an advocate of fire and brimstone, but that may help clear this brain freeze!" 
Spark Syrup: "My child, distilled energy is no substitute for natural revelation."
Molten Metal: "I seek communion with nature, not... industrial revolution."
Lava Lamp: "I appreciate modern expressions of faith, but perhaps something more... traditional?"
